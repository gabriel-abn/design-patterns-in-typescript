# Abstract Factory

## Intent

Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Applicability

Use the Abstract Factory pattern when:

- a system should be independent of how its products are created, composed, and represented.
- a system should be configured with one of multiple families of products.
- a family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
